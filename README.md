# Hotel Management - Java Console-based Project

Hotel Management is a console-based Java project that provides a basic management system for a hotel. It allows users to perform various operations related to managing hotel rooms, reservations, and customer information.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of Java programming language and console-based user input/output.

## How to Run the Application

1. Clone the repository or download the source code to your local machine.

2. Open the terminal (Command Prompt) and navigate to the project directory.

3. Compile the Java source files using the following command:

   ```shell
   javac Main.java
   ```

4. Start the application by running the following command:

   ```shell
   java Main
   ```

5. The application will display a menu of available options. Follow the prompts and enter the appropriate numbers to perform desired operations.

6. Use the application's menu to create rooms, make reservations, view customer information, and perform other management tasks.

7. Exit the application by selecting the appropriate option from the menu.

## File Structure

The project directory contains the following files:

- `Main.java`: This file contains the main entry point of the application. It displays the menu options and handles user input.

- `Hotel.java`: This file defines the `Hotel` class, which represents the hotel and contains methods for managing rooms and reservations.

- `Room.java`: This file defines the `Room` class, which represents a hotel room and contains information such as room number, availability status, and price.

- `Reservation.java`: This file defines the `Reservation` class, which represents a reservation made by a customer and contains information such as the customer name, room number, and dates.

## How it Works

The Hotel Management application allows users to perform various tasks related to hotel management. Here's a high-level overview of how it works:

1. The application starts by displaying a menu of available options to the user.

2. The user can select different options such as creating rooms, making reservations, viewing customer information, etc.

3. When creating rooms, the user can specify the room number, price, and availability status. The room information is stored in the `Hotel` class.

4. When making a reservation, the user enters the customer name, room number, and dates. The application checks the room availability and creates a new reservation if the room is available.

5. The user can view customer information, which displays a list of all reservations made by customers.

6. The application continues to display the menu after completing each operation, allowing the user to perform additional tasks or exit the application.

## Customize and Extend

You can customize and extend the Hotel Management application according to your specific requirements. Here are some possible improvements or features you can add:

- Implement a database: Instead of storing data in memory, you can integrate a database system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to store and retrieve hotel, room, and reservation information.

- Enhance search functionality: Add search capabilities to allow users to search for specific reservations or rooms based on criteria such as dates, customer names, or room types.

- Implement billing and payment features: Extend the application to calculate and manage billing and payment for reservations.

- Improve error handling and input validation: Enhance the application by validating user input and handling potential errors or edge cases gracefully.
